# Kodi SponsorBlock

This is an **unofficial** port of the [SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app/) browser extension.
It works as an extension to the [YouTube Plugin](https://github.com/jdf76/plugin.video.youtube).

Once installed, the addon will automatically skip sponsor segments in all YouTube videos you watch.

For a detailed explanation of how SponsorSkip works please visit the [offical website](https://sponsor.ajay.app/).


## Installation

The addon is available in [siku2's repository](https://siku2.io/kodi-repository).

1. Install [siku2's repository](https://siku2.io/kodi-repository/install)
2. Go to "Add-ons" > "Install from repository" > "siku2's Repository"
